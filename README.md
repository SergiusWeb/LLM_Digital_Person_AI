# Russian Questions to SQL

This project aims to convert questions in Russian into SQL queries using a trained model.

## Description

The project includes the following steps:
1. Loading and preprocessing data.
2. Training a model to generate SQL queries.
3. Generating SQL queries based on Russian questions.
4. Checking results and handling errors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository URL>
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `main.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data and generate SQL queries.

## Data

The dataset `wikisql_processed_data.csv` should be placed in the same directory as the notebook.

## Examples

Here is an example of an SQL query generated by the model:
```sql
SELECT column6 FROM table_name WHERE column4 = 'SOUTH AUSTRALIA'
```

## Error Checking

The project includes error checking to prevent the use of invalid indices in SQL queries.
